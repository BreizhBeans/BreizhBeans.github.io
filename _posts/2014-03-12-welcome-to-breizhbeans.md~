Hello all, and welcome to [BreizhBeans](http://breizhbeans.org), a developer community from the westernmost corner of mainland France, in the Finist√®re province of the Brittany region.

We are some of the guys behind some others local communities like the [FinistJUG](http://finistjug.fr) or the [FinistGDG](http://finistgdg.org). So, why BreizhBeans? We see BreizhBeans like a more eclectic project, not bound to any technology or company, often dealing with subjects crossing different user groups'  boundaries. It's also a more personal project, deeply local, our meeting point was being developers who lived in this far corner of Brittany and who wanted to remain living here while doing an interesting job (not always an easy thing).

We are not tied to any technology, playing with lots of different toys:
